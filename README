This is a library and command line to parse XML files generated by the
Exif4Film Android app.

The application no longer exists. [PetaPixel has talked about
it](https://petapixel.com/2012/07/30/exif4film-helps-analog-photographers-infuse-metadata-into-film-photos/). This
is not associated in anyway with CodeUnited, the author of the Android
app.

This has been written without documentation of the format.

Requirements

Go
  - Modules will be automatically installed
Exempi 2.x

Building on Linux and maybe macOS:

```
make
```

Using the tool:

For an export named `FILE.xml`, run:

```
./e4f-go -dump -format text -list -roll 0 FILE.xml
```

Using `-format xml` will output XMP for each frame.
